# LC-Solution-Sales-Analysis
## A Project by LC Solution Ltd

### INTRODUCTION

This analysis was made to detail the structure and sales pattern of some products used in offices around several states. The process of production of this product was distributed across various markets and the sales data was provided but incomplete, some key performance indicators for financials and effective running of a business wasnâ€™t included and without this KPIs the analysis will not be reliable for decision making and this was where Data Analysis Expression (DAX) was used.

### DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS (DAX)

DAX is a formula expression language used in analysis services, Power BI and power pivot in Excel. DAX formulas include functions, operators and values to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in related tables and columns. It is a functional language and can be used to generate new columns, new tables and measures.

In this analysis DAX was used to create several columns that are not included in the sales data but are KPIs for the business and are significant to the analysis for effective decisions making. DAX was also used to create a new table in this analysis to track trends over time regarding the sales data and also for measures.

* New Columns: Also known as calculated columns are useful when a required reporting field is missing from the original data and it can be generated using DAX.

 The Data analysis expressions was used to create additional column for the region number, and calculated column for total return on Investment(Total ROI), provided that the data already include some relevant fields to provide other relevant fields needed for analysis.

* Measures: Measures are computations in Power BI, executed and displayed on a visual. They are summarization of data and it uses simple aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT etc. Measures was used in this analysis to calculate the total revenue across all products supplied in the various markets and states.

### DATA VISUALIZATION

The dashboard created answered the following questions.

* What key products are the drivers of performance?

* If a product is to be discontinued due to poor outcomes, what product would this be?

* Top 10 market in relative to revenue

* Top 10 stores in relative to revenue and units sold
