# LC-Solution-Sales-Analysis
## A Project by LC Solution Ltd

### INTRODUCTION

This analysis was made to detail the structure and sales pattern of some products used in offices around several states. The process of production of this product was distributed across various markets and the sales data was provided but incomplete, some key performance indicators for financials and effective running of a business wasnâ€™t included and without this KPIs the analysis will not be reliable for decision making and this was where Data Analysis Expression (DAX) was used.

### DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS (DAX)

DAX is a formula expression language used in analysis services, Power BI and power pivot in Excel. DAX formulas include functions, operators and values to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in related tables and columns. It is a functional language and can be used to generate new columns, new tables and measures.

In this analysis DAX was used to create several columns that are not included in the sales data but are KPIs for the business and are significant to the analysis for effective decisions making. DAX was also used to create a new table in this analysis to track trends over time regarding the sales data and also for measures.

* New Columns: Also known as calculated columns are useful when a required reporting field is missing from the original data and it can be generated using DAX.

 The Data analysis expressions was used to create additional column for the region number, and calculated column for total return on Investment(Total ROI), provided that the data already include some relevant fields to provide other relevant fields needed for analysis.

* Measures: Measures are computations in Power BI, executed and displayed on a visual. They are summarization of data and it uses simple aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT etc. Measures was used in this analysis to calculate the total revenue across all products supplied in the various markets and states.

### DATA VISUALIZATION

The dashboard created answered the following questions.

* What key products are the drivers of performance?

* If a product is to be discontinued due to poor outcomes, what product would this be?

* Top 10 market in relative to revenue

* The key products driving performance are Service Plan, Parts and Copier Sale

* Printer Sale and Copier Sale should be discontinued based on poor outcomes and also the cost of production of this products are relatively too high compare to their outcome, very low profit.

* Ekiti state market was discovered to be a sales hotspot with #5.57bn of the total revenue coming from customers in Ekiti, with Abia state market and Bayelsa state market ranking second and third with #5.0bn and #4.2bn respectively.

* With the products being in the Day Category, you would think that the top sale would-be made in the public holiday or season period but after analysis of the data, it was discovered that over three quarter of the total orders were from the regular workday Consumer category with 742,324 of the total orders and customers in the Local holiday category at the tail end with 2,759.

* Analysis of the general performance of the store began with a trend of sales for each month which showed a slow and unsteady increase in the number of products ordered every year with an increase in the number of orders for office supplies as the end of the year approaches, possibly due to customers preparing for the New Year.

* It was also observed that Chibok Store was the least store with a record sales loss of #31,680 in revenue.
